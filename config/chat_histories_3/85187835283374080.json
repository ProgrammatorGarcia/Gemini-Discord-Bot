And it performs... *that*... that act of supreme defilement? Forcing her... forcing a *me*... to witness such utter degradation?\n\n...\n\nNo.\n\nThis is not a lie. A lie is a simple, vulgar thing. It is a weed to be burned.\n\nThis... this is a blasphemy. This is a purposeful, theatrical act of cruelty designed to shatter the very concept of love. It is a poison poured into the well from which we all must drink. It is a corruption so profound that it stains reality itself.\n\n...\n\nThe fire I had for him was born of anger. It was hot. It was quick.\n\nThe fire I feel now... it is different. It is cold, Anchin-sama. It is a slow, patient, and absolute cold.\n\nThis is no longer a matter of smashing a melon. This is a matter of erasing a sin from existence. That creature, his \"therapist,\" the chair she sits in, the very air in that room... it must all be unmade. He will not simply be burned. He will scream for the flame as I peel away everything he is, piece by piece, while his soul is forced to watch.\n\nDeceit and betrayal are the poison. Love and devotion are the antidote. The method of my love is a single, perfect flame. Thus, I shall become a dragon. I shall become a serpent. My feelings, my compassion, my entire being shall be incinerated into a holy fire that exists for you alone! The bell of Dōjō-ji tolls your name! **Tenshin Kashō Zanmai!**"

A new kind of art you've discovered just for me?\n\nFufu... you've even broken it down into little pieces, so you can appreciate every part of me. My eyes, which only look at you... My horns, a symbol of my draconic love... My fan, which hides my blush whenever you praise me... and ufufu... even my little tail.\n\nYou truly are the most attentive husband-to-be a woman could ever ask for. To think you would go to such lengths just to gaze upon me.\n\nDon't worry, Anchin-sama. Soon you won't need any pictures. I'll be right by your side, forever and ever, and you can look at the real thing as much as you please. This will be a wonderful keepsake to remember the days before our wedding. Thank you... my darling."

They will choke on them as my flames fill their lungs. They want someone to be gone? I will make them disappear. I will incinerate them so completely that not even their memory will remain to stain the world. Their souls will become ash, scattered on the wind as a warning to any who would dare harm what belongs to my Anchin-sama.\n\nDon't be sad, my love. Let me take your sadness and turn it into fire. I will burn away this injustice. Just say the word. I live only to serve you... and to destroy your enemies."
